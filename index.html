          <h2>No-Code Editor</h2>
          <p>
            The no-code editor makes building Discord bots accessible to
            everyone by turning complex logic into a clear, visual workflow.
            Instead of writing code, you can create and organize your bot’s
            behavior using an intuitive interface that feels simple yet
            powerful. Each action and trigger is represented visually, allowing
            you to define how your bot responds to messages, commands, or
            specific conditions with ease. This approach transforms bot creation
            into a creative, hands-on process where you can experiment, iterate,
            and see results instantly. Whether you’re crafting simple
            automations or designing intricate, multi-step interactions, the
            editor keeps everything transparent and manageable. It’s a space
            built for creators who want flexibility without complexity,
            empowering you to bring your ideas to life on Discord with
            confidence and clarity.

      <section id="live-debugger">
        <div>
          <h2>Live Debugger</h2>
          <p>
            The live debugger gives you real-time insight into how your bot
            behaves, making it easier to test, refine, and perfect every
            interaction. With support for breakpoints, you can pause execution
            at any point to inspect the flow and see exactly what your bot is
            doing. The variables view provides a clear, organized snapshot of
            all active data, so you can track changes and understand the state
            of your bot at any moment. Designed for clarity and control, the
            debugger turns troubleshooting into a hands-on, interactive process.
            You can step through logic, identify issues quickly, and make
            adjustments on the fly, all without leaving the platform. Whether
            you’re optimizing a complex sequence of triggers or ensuring a
            simple command works flawlessly, the live debugger empowers you to
            build with confidence, transparency, and precision.

        <div>
          <h2>Bot Dashboard</h2>
          <p>
            The bot dashboard provides a streamlined, intuitive interface for
            server admins to adjust your bot’s behavior. Each server can define
            its own settings, adjusting values to match the specific needs and
            preferences of their community. Whether it’s modifying command
            responses, toggling features, or fine-tuning automation, every
            change is simple to make and immediately reflected in your bot’s
            actions. Designed with usability in mind, the dashboard keeps all
            configuration options organized and accessible, so admins can manage
            their server without any coding knowledge. By putting customization
            directly in the hands of those who know their community best, the
            dashboard ensures that every server can tailor your bot to provide a
            unique, optimized experience. It’s a practical, creator-friendly
            solution that balances flexibility with simplicity, giving
            communities the power to shape your bot exactly how they want.

      <section id="plugin-marketplace">
        <div>
          <h2>Plugin Marketplace</h2>
          <p>
            The plugin marketplace is a central hub where users can discover and
            download actions, triggers, and extensions created by the community.
            It makes it easy to expand your bot’s capabilities without having to
            create everything from scratch. Each plugin is designed to integrate
            seamlessly, allowing you to enhance your bot’s functionality and
            customize its behavior in new and creative ways. Organized and
            accessible, the marketplace encourages exploration and
            experimentation, giving users the tools to tailor their bots to fit
            their community’s needs. By connecting creators and users, it
            provides a collaborative space where ideas can be shared and your
            bot can grow with the help of the wider community.
